Syntax highlighting can be used with triple backticks, like so:

```
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
```
{%- highlight javascript -%}
/*Some pointless Javascript*/
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
{%- endhighlight -%}

Use two trailing spaces

on the right

to create linebreak tags

Finally, horizontal lines

### 3\. Plan for play.

Although planning for play sounds ingenue, it’s important to give yourself and the team the space and time to let your hair down.

### 4\. More “Yes and…”, avoid “ Yes but…”

In Tina Fey’s bestselling book, [Bossypants](#), Fey outlines the rules of improv: Always say “Yes, and…” meaning, always agree, and add something to the discussion. “Yes, but…” is the evil twin to “Yes, and…”, halting collaboration, negotiation and effective communication. This small, positive communication tool makes a huge difference.

### 5\. Give yourself and your team room for optimism.

Similar to planning for play, intentionally giving yourself and the team room for optimism allows promotes & cultivates positive morale which ends up being super infectious. Optimism starts at the top. Curate your own belief first. If you believe it—and show it—your team will too.
