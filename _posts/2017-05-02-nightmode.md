## <mark>Update â€“ March 2019</mark>

Night/Dark mode is the default theme as it's my prefered theme. A theme toggle is now in the menu on mobile or top left of the screen on desktop. ðŸŒ‘

## <mark class="line-through">Update â€“ July 2018</mark>

There is now a Nightmode toggle in the right hand menu. Click on the moon icon to check it out.

As a fun weekend project, I implemented a _Nightmode_ thatÂ kicks in between 6:00pm & 8:00am.  

Want to check it out before 6pm? Add `class: "night"` to the body tag in the DOM.
